* Changes Summary *

- The Sound class now works as a thread to allow user to continue to interact with the GUI while a sound is playing.

- Now includes an image of a fretboard lined up with the appropriate buttons for each string.

- Each button now has a separate ActionListener. 

- Now each time the user clicks a sound button, it stops/interrupts the current Sound thread (if one is running),
  creates a new Sound thread, and runs the thread.
  
- The application will now have the look and feel of the OS it is running on.
